          <text value="&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Board Instructions: &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toguz Korgool employs a board such as the one shown below. The board consists of two sides: a white/light side and a black/dark side. The player on the white/light side starts the board. Each player side has nine holes, numbered 1-9 from left to right, and one larger rectangular store called the player's kazan. Initially, 162 korgools (small round stones) are distributed equally over the 18 holes in the board: 9 korgools per hole. No stones are placed in the player's kazans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Moves: &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Players make moves by selecting one of the holes on their side of the board that contains korgools. A move consists of taking all the korgools from the selected hole and redistributing or seeding them to other holes in the anticlockwise direction. The first korgool is put in the hole the korgools were taken from. The next korgool goes in the adjacent hole to the right, and so on. Once the player has dropped a korgool in hole 9, the next korgool goes into hole 1 of the other player, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The player on the white/light side makes the first move. Players alternate between making moves.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The normal redistribution rule does not apply if there is only one korgool in a hole. If there is only one korgool in a hole and that hole is selected for a move, the hole is emptied and the korgool is moved to the next hole.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the last korgool in a move ends up in an opponent's hole, and the number of korgools in that hole is now even, then the player captures all the korgools in that hole. The korgools are moved into the player's kazan.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the last korgool in a move ends up in the player's own side, nobody captures these korgools.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the last korgool in a move ends up in an opponent's hole, and the number of korgools in that hole is now odd, then nobody captures these korgools.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the last korgool in a move ends up in an opponent's hole containing two korgools (i.e. the hole contains three korgools at the end of the move), then this hole is marked as a tuz. This means that this hole now belongs to the player who claimed the tuz and all korgools in the tuz are transferred to the owner's kazan. The following restrictions apply: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Each player can claim only one tuz.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A tuz cannot be moved.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hole 9 cannot be claimed as tuz.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If one player has claimed hole n as tuz, then their opponent can no longer claim hole n on the opposite side as tuz.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;The board ends when one player has collected 82 or more korgools in their kazan.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;/html&gt;"/>
